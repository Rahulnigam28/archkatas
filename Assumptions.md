# Assumptions

* Fridges are able to communicate via https or similar secure connection.
* Bidirectional communication with fridges is supported.
* Scaling is not crucial for the initial proposal (currently only like thousands of users expected).
* Fridge is able to maintain correct inventory synchronization with backend.
* Offline (fridge not connected) mode doesn't need to be supported initially.
* Time to market is critical
